# Captain Falcon Red Costume

Captain Falcon has one notable file-format exception: the red costume is commonly encountered as a `.usd` file instead of the normal costume `.dat`.

That does **not** mean it is a fundamentally different kind of mod file. It is still the actual costume archive for that skin.

## The Core Rule

Most character costumes follow the usual pattern:

- `PlXxYy.dat`

Captain Falcon's red slot is the exception:

- in this repo's existing metadata, it shows up as `PlCaRe`
- in modding notes, you may also see people write `PlCaRd`
- the important part is that this red Falcon costume is the one special slot that may use `.usd`

## What `.usd` Means Here

As noted in the Melee file reference, `.usd` is basically `.dat` with extra localization data.

So for Captain Falcon red, the safe mental model is:

- it is still a normal costume archive
- it still belongs to Falcon's red costume slot
- the unusual part is the container or extension, not the basic role of the file

## Why This Matters

This is easy to miss if you only scan character archives for `.dat` files.

In practice, the important takeaway is:

- do not assume every valid character costume must end in `.dat`
- do not dismiss Falcon red just because it appears as `.usd`
- treat this as a file-naming and container exception, not a separate mod category

## Scope Note

This page only covers the red-costume file-format exception.

Captain Falcon also has ECB differences, but that is a separate topic and is not documented here yet.
