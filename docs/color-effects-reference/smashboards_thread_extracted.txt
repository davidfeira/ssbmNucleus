Yay, I had a feeling this might get your attention! Add whatever you would like, cause I am hoping this will kind of turn into a compendium for cosmetic changes in Melee.

Also, I probably worded that badly. I just remembered that you said you found it thanks to matoooya's beam sword, so i guess that is another thing that follows the format.

So this is a wonderful guide so far, I've been focusing on these types of color changes recently as I've already got a hacked melee set up with character skins and stages that I want and most of the music I'll be using. But I want to take the texture changing of the game to a further level, and this thread is where I've come.

Again, what you have so far is great but I'm a little eager to change other characters special effects, as well as more in depth things like the actual fire colors of the falcon punch/kick, the firefox/falco. I've basically tried all of the things so far and they're pretty accurate (except for some of the peach offsets, but I was able to manage). So I'm waiting patiently now I guess until more is posted because I can't seem to either have the tools to search through Hex and find new things, or I just don't understand it enough to make any connections to things.

I'm just so appalled that you've been able to find out these color formats and recognize which article in the game that they correspond to. I searched online for a hex editor that was color coded based on RRGGBB formatted colors, but I couldn't find one nor may that even be possible (although I mean anything is possible).

So yeah, great stuff so far and I look forward to a lot more and I'm even available to help if there is anything I can do.

I updated the first post with a new format (CF ## color format)!!! Lots of updates coming this week as I just finished my projects and tests.

Nopfed, Thanks for the feedback! I will reply to you more fully tomorrow, but the more in depth stuff is definitely possible :D

Also, I would love to hear all feedback! If you don't like how the guide is formatted, don't understand a concept fully, have a question for me, or don't know wtf is going on, I want to hear it!

@hitbox guide: is this really relevant to the thread? Magus' posts on hitboxes is really thorough and can already be found on the first page of the main hacks thread.

Good stuff on the falcon punch tho. didn't expect it to be a texture. stopped looking last year when i couldn't locate it despite finding all the cf## offsets.

 Awesome! That info would be nice to have.
 
 

 
Unfortunately I'm also waaaaay lazy when it comes to stuff like that and I have a lot of other stuff on my plate. I should also note that I have a bunch of offsets for article floats.

I should seriously just release all the content that I've had for over a year. I've had a project in the works for a while that I'm going to keep under wraps, but I also have a bunch of other janky stuff that's worth showing off.

Problem is that it needs to be cleaned up a bit and I'm not interested in releasing an inferior product.

is there any way of assigning hitbox data specific to a certain color? i know it's really far-fetched, since I'm guessing you can only have one character file >.<

You mean Red Falco and Blue Falco having different hitbox data? I'm afraid it is impossible with what I know

--- Post #20 ---
User: standardtoaster

That is absolutely impossible with melee the way it is now. Someone would have to create a clone engine, which will most likely never happen, especially for melee.

Wow thanks for all the compliments guys.

I still have a week of getting owned (2 tests today, 1 Wednesday, 2 projects due by the end of the week, and oodles of homework ), but when that is over it will be Thanksgiving Break and I will be doing new things! This stuff is like crack XD.

I'm planning on making an ISO with a lot of color changes, if there are things you have in mind feel free to post them or PM them too me. I always like to hear lots of ideas.

Would it be possible for you to change the rest of falcon's fire to blue as well? I'm talking mainly about falcon kick and raptor boost

Would you be able to change the Aura on Ganon's UpB to a Darkness aura? I tried doing it myself, but couldn't find the right location. An electricity aura might look nicer - I was planning on messing around with it once I found the location.

Also, I noticed that for a very short time Ganon is yellow during his Warlock Punch, which looks like an aura. If you could make that Darkness too, I'd appreciate it.

 could anyone tell me how marths sword tail color works? (the second color) i tried using the RR GG BB color format, doesn't work, and i tried the RG BY value list, doesn't work either, so i've jsut been inputing random letters or numbers and so far all i got is blue, white, purple and pink, does anybody know Black or red or anything else?
 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

RRGGBB color format is correct.

--- Post #33 ---
User: Lanceinthepants

I've looked forever IE and I never found it. The texture for the shield is in the PlCo file. I'm pretty sure the dol file decides the color based on your port and if you are on a team.

I'm a little confused in changing Falcon's b punch, it says in one of lanceinthepants post (first page) the offsets, but i don't know how i'm supposed to change the texture, as in the actual falcon punch, not just the smoke colors or the lens, how do i change the color there?

User: SypherPhoenix

I don't really know what you're asking, but if by chance you're talking about turning the Falcon from FP into something else, that's probably a model hack of some sort.

----------------------------------------
So after about 6 months of taking a break of this melee color hacking stuff I decided to look back into it and i'm glad this thread is still going. I just revamped my hacked melee to a more soft hack.

Since I main Doc I was looking around for the colors of his pills, but with the current guides I don't think they follow any of them, unless they follow the 98 ## ## format and I'm too lazy to decode the 16bit colors...

But anyway I was wondering if anyone else tried changing this? I noticed doc doesn't have his own Effects file, and shares the basic effects with mario (downB and upB, I was able to change the blue tornado of downB to lime green). Doc's cape is separate from mario's as we know, so i'm wondering if the pills are in doc's pldr.dat file or somewhere random in the EfMrData file. 

any help would be appreciated!

--- Post #40 ---
User: SypherPhoenix

I would guess that it's in the same file as Doc's cape, but I don't know where that is.

Ok, so I guess I need to apply:

Firefox _9 texture between 18DA0 and 19D9F

Palette between 19DA0 and 19F9F

But uh, what does that mean? xD

Is there some tool the automatically finds the differences in hex values between two files? That would be an easy way to find the offsets for bower's fire.

--- Post #46 ---
User: standardtoaster

Have both files open in HxD and press ctrl + k. Then keep pressing F6. It'll go through showing you all of the differences.

--- Post #47 ---
User: Lanceinthepants

It means that in those offsets is a _9 texture that is the texture applied to the firefox.

These are two guides that can help you get started with texture hacking.

Alot of special moves are made up of the formats in this guide, textures, and most likely stuff I don't even know about.

Is it possible for you to give me the adress codes for the background / cloud texture colors during Final Destination's white phase? This transition is giving me transitions every time, so I want to make it black instead. I've tried hacking it on my own, but I didn't get very far. I've only managed to make part of the clouds black.

Will 12$ be enough for this?

Edit: Of course, GrNLa.dat without the black phase would be even better.

You could, but the character will no longer be pal. You can still toggle it, but if you still want it to be pal, you'll have manually hex edit it or use the laser changer program.

edit: but if the dat is different from ntsc, then the laser changer program might not work I'd assume.

 Realized I posted in the wrong thread, but does anyone know how to edit the blue tint on fox/falco when holding shine?

Or if not does anyone know a good way to start looking for the address?
 
 

 
read op?

Thanks for the help LOL

Nah man Ive read every page in this thread multiple times. There's a ton it seems people don't know and I have no coding experience I'm just a graphics guy and I'm just wondering if people have figured more stuff out.

In regard to reading the op, I've searched EfFxData.dat, and PIFx.dat for 070707, 4248, 9800, and CF refs and trial and error'd as many as I could find that looked like color references (I think I've literally spent 20 hours the past 2 days on this now). A few of them crashed the game at parts and none of them changed the tint. I saw someone used developer dolphin to check the memory address being referenced in game when lasering, I tried to use dev mode but I honestly had no idea what I was doing.

Tint I'm talking about

 Oh. I know what that is. Its an Aura. You'll have to search through for a completely unknown format that I have very little documentation on. Might be in the PlCo.dat c:

Sorry. Just saying it as it is. If you want SOME documentation. I have an example of one. Never figured that stuff out completely though. I'll post the documentation I have on it in about an hour or so. Don't have the file on hand at this moment.
 
 

 
Damnnnnn i was worried it would be something like that. From what I've seen those aura effects are scattered randomly throughout? Assuming its the same as adding darkness or lightning to fox's firefox. Documentation would be sick if you have stuff

Body auras.

Change the byte @ 0x3CD1. This is part of his lowspecial subaction script data (the stuff Crazy Hand shows you). 

And that offset is for grounded down-b. There should be another for aerial down-b.

So i tried to change the color of Marth's Sword swing. I went to HxD changed the correct color files. Saved it. Imported it with GCRebuilder. Opened the new iso. And every time i load a stage with marth it freezes. Help me please.

Edit: The part that i am worried about is where i changed the hex color code. I used the code you showed in your example on the first tutorial when you were first talking about sword hitboxes. i think it was like 3940. I dont know if i changed the right code.

Edit: never mind. Figured it out. I didnt import it correctly.

Like this?

 
 

 
 

 

Info on this here, in the first section, "Changing Fundamental Texture Properties". Basically, you need to change the image type to use _5 instead of _3.

Attached are these hand textures, if anyone wants to try some stuff with them. They were an unfinished experiment though, and the aspects that interact with the coin don't align to the right part of the image.

 Awesome! I'm just now seeing the updates on the dust & smoke offsets. This is pretty cool. For my application though, it kind of sucks that there are so many locations, because I want to change them all to be completely invisible. I'm not really afraid of the extra work, just of possibly not being able to find some of them. (I was hoping in this case there would just be a few shared textures, so removing/altering a handful would remove them all.)

I tried changing the transparency value shown below (after the header 111E4C, shown above in Pichu's fsmash) to 00 and to FF, but I couldn't tell a difference with either of those values (original was 07). The wind/smoke effects seemed to all still be visible.

In the OP you said "[The Transparency Control] value controls the transparency of your effect. I have found changing this value either will crash your game or make the effect disappear completely, so I always leave it alone." What did you set it to to make the effect disappear? I'm wondering if this is not actually a value range.

well actually I never messed with the transparency values, I just included them in the infographic because I saw them in Lance's post, and he also said that changing the transparency might crash the game, so your results are not unexpected, sadly. So yeah Lance is the one to ask about transparency.

Sorry if I didn't make it clear, but it is in there.

. . .

I've added to the download it now has magenta lasers and shine(old was purple for both), changed the 1st frames of shine to match the later ones, every character with a sword now has the same sword trail as Marth, I changed peaches turnips and umbrella(screenshots in folder in the download), changed Ness's aura on his side B, changed his Up-B and neutral B(screenshots in folder in the download), G&W colors have been changed, green=white, blue=magenta, inside of re-spawn platform folder there is an alternate download that has black shields and death flash for all ports, and every character has darkness effect while charging smashes.

EDIT: Dark Rainbow Shine added to Fox and Falco folder, also has a pic of it in the folder.

Great work. I've been trying to download the dark rainbow shine but I don't see a link. Also, if you were to use the dark firefox I'm guessing it wouldn't be possible to change the shine/laser colors? I noticed that to install the firefox you have to overwrite the files that would be used for shine and lasers.

 Working off of the above, how would I go about completely REMOVING the textures, rather than changing their color?

I wanted to get rid of them for something I'm working on. I tried simply changing the opacity values to 00, but it didn't work. I assume I could inject blank images with the same dimensions in place of the texture files (making the color changing effects do nothing). But how do I do that? How do I extract/modify/reinject them?
 
 

 
well they are just textures, I think you could theoretically find all of them and replace them with completely blank textures? idk thats my idea.

So you have been talking about your project that includes removing all the dust textures. whats the project?

--- Post #121 ---
User: DRGN
Date: Jul 24, 2014
----------------------------------------
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Using Dolphin I went ahead and dumped probably most of the smoke and dust textures just to take a look at them. I've never modified CSPs before either, but I've been reading more about those, and am now wondering if these smoke textures can be modified in the same way. Using TCS scripts and TexConv.exe, I figure if I can get the images back into their native TPL format that Nintendo uses, then I should theoretically be able to search for the exact hex data of each image in EfCoData that needs to be replaced. (And I figure I can create an all-black image as well as an all-white image of the same file, then compare what is the same between the two to determine how big the headers are, which I don't want to touch.) So that's my current thought process anyway; I haven't tried any of this yet.

Well, I don't think I want to reveal the project just yet for a few reasons (unless you want to PM me if you're really curious; that's fine). But it involves batch processing of a lot of images using a few gimp scripts I wrote. The problem is, the smoke and dust effects mess with the pixel selections, and obscures some of the image I want to be visible. Manually selecting the areas in the images is out of the question. If I can't remove the smoke, I could rip the images I need now with the smoke included, and then later if I learn how to remove it, I could RE-rip them (and reprocess them). But that would suck since it's a long process, even with the automation I have to do it. The alternative is to come up with better selection processes to deal with the smoke.

EfCoData(Original).dat

Always have a backup unmodified Melee ISO so you can extract any original files you need.

Did you actually extend the length of the PlPe.dat file? What did you modify in it? If all you are doing is opening it up and changing hex values, this should not be an issue. This goes without saying, but make sure you are using/replacing the correct file.

I was changing hex values for Peach's umbrella and turnips and when I finished I went to go replace the file and the file size wouldn't match up. It was a late night when I did it. If I accidentally replaced it with the wrong file could it be reverted?

The size of the file will change if you delete or insert data, but not if you overwrite, which is what you'll want to do. I know the hex editing program HxD will warn you if you're about to change the file size, but I don't know what program you're using.

Just go with it. You can use IrfanView to convert to targa when you're done editing (or if you're photoshop, you can do it directly)

 I am attempting to make a pink falcon punch, and Ive followed the guide of how to do the 777 and CF## etc. codes, so now the extra particles and such are pink, but I cant figure out how to actually change the color of the FALCON. or any of the fire moves he has... is that pertaining to the cosmetic elemental stuff?
 
 

 
They're textures.

Have you dumped the textures for it already? Or if not, do you know how to using Dolphin? Once you have them, you can edit them in an image editor (adjust the hue so they look like the pink you want). Then convert the textures to TPL format, and put the textures into EfCaData.dat at the offsets (the addresses where the texture starts) that Lanceinthepants showed (this thread can help with that).

I don't know if you've done parts of this already, but if so, which part are you stuck on?

So im trying to change falco phantasm color, but im not sure about what are the color values. The original post about changing the values relies on the guys (i think by noob?) images, but the images are taken down. I know the offset is 1ec40. And i tried looking for the color header 070707 but the header for it is 070007. If anyone could tell me what values to change to change the color i would greatly appreciate it. I was trying to make them i pink, but ended up with a teal.

So, I have this spreadsheet: Effects Texture Locations (& some random stuff here)

Tabbed for different files. I'm still planning on adding to it, at least for characters.

Now obviously, effect textures and effect colors are really closely related, and any time somebody would want to work with one part, they might like to think about working with the other as well. Could definitely make some cool stuff by combining such hacks I think. So maybe we should think of a way to combine these two databases. Maybe we should just put it all in spreadsheets.

Sounds like you're looking for a line numbered 1EC48. Offsets and the numbering you're looking at is per-digit-pair (per-byte) in the file, not per-line. And one line = 0x10 (which is actually 16 bytes) which is why the lines have intervals at 1EC40, 1EC50, 1EC60, etc. So if 1EC40 is the beginning of the line, then 1EC48 would be half way down it. If you start clicking around in the file, you'll see "Offset: ___" in the bottom left of the program (assuming you're using HxD) which tells you the exact position you're at in the file. You can also see numbering across the top of the columns, which, if you add that to the line you're at, also gives you the position (i.e. 1EC40 + 08 = 1EC48). Hope that makes sense.

Not sure if this has been posted yet. But a lot of Falco uploads that I've seen are using the default orange on the inside of his jacket. This was a 8x8 texture on Fox, but on Falco it isn't...

Offset: 00007C00 - 80 48 1F FF F7 87 2C FF FF FF FF FF 3F 80 00 00 42 48

I'm fairly certain that both of these elements that you guys are having trouble with changing are colours already applied to the textures. I might be wrong, but I think I've seen them before when dumping textures from Dolphin.

Start dashing with Kirby --> pause game --> Delete all textures that have been dumped for GALE01 --> resume game --> do a dash attack --> pause at the end --> look at textures in GALE01 folder.

Has anyone ever bothered indexing any of Ganondorf's EfGnData.dat offsets? Also, from what I gather there are textures in this file, is it possible to extract them?

 

I'm working on a fairly comprehensive hack, I've tried a whole bunch of the stuff in the first post already, but in the process I managed to make some of the effects disappear so I basically have to start over. Just curious if anyone else has ever written anything down, figure I could use that as a starting point and expand on it.

I think I did this at one point a few years ago on complete accident....I totally forget what I did though. I think I zeroed out a whole bunch of code towards the end of the DOL file. It had tons of side effects lol. Like none of the characters had names at the character select screen (like where the name tag is) and the text for "4-man survival test" and what not was just completely blank. Idk...I can't really give you anymore details than that because I have no clue what I did exactly.

thanks for reminding me, I was going to explain my process.

The very first thing I did was open up an efcodata.dat and change all FFFFFF to FF0000, then I ran the game, and every effect that was changed to red was in the file. Next I started searching all the headers, starting with 070707. I started by changing groups of offsets that I thought were related. I noticed a lot of patterns too, like 42 48 headers most commonly use 808080 as grey, while 070707 uses 7f7f7f as grey, also, the 070707 headers usually have a transparency of 07 or 04. For the CF## headers I would change a lot of offsets at once and record what effects where what colors, then for the next test, I would split up one color into 2 or 3 colors and look for the same effect, so I could find one offset out of 50 in "log(base 3) of 320" tests, because I used 3 colors each test and there were 320 cf## offsets I was interested in. In the end I had like 50 CF## offsets and I just changed them 4 at a time and ran the game till I found stuff. I think the whole thing took like 8 hours of work maybe. there are still a LOT of cf## headers I didnt mess with, and a lot of 070707 headers I recorded but didn't mess with, they are in a text file in my .rar.

Im trying to make the shine into a square or triangle, but mostly find out how to change it into any shape.

are you changing that specific offset, or the color under that offset header? The offsets I put in the pictures are the offsets of the color header, not the offsets of the color value itself. I mostly found 070707 and CF## headers, read about changing them in the first post on this thread. (dont worry its easy)

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

The offset 113dec is the location of the color header. Only change the values color1 and color2. In the case of 070707 headers, the offset of color1 will always be 4 greater than the value I provide, and the offset of color2 will always be 8 greater than the offset I provide.

I have noticed color 1 is usually the fill, or inside color, and color 2 is usually the stroke, or outside color of a shape.

 I recently made a black and red shine that I'm pretty proud of so I thought I'd stick it up here. I also included that awesome purple firefox/firebird and my purple fox lasers and pale green borderline silver falco lasers. Download link is here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ppiv4sak0z9y2tn/AAAIABdPv8fw27tVK3GL9xFoa?dl=0
 
 

 
I really like the red and black shine.

 (And/or anyone else who can help) How would I go about editing the "Stage Select" text on the CSS, as well as the image in the circle to the left of it? Do you know the offsets, and if so, do I just edit the .tgl files (I have them downloaded), and then replace them using DAT Texture Wizard?

EDIT: I want to change the text but I'm not sure if I can do so with a hex editor.

 I'm assuming that you mean the bottom right text. It's at 6A740 in the MnSlMap.usd, here's the texture to edit: 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 . 

Also, here's all the letters dumped from smashbros: http://www.mediafire.com/download/z5de6nj1ew1g5r2/Letters.7z, I don't remember who posted it or where, but credit to them. 

And the color effect for it is at 95A00.

You need to change the STAGE SELECT text as the texture in black and white, I like using the smash letters, and then you can adjust the colors using the effect. As nice as it would be you can't change the text itself in the file, you need to make the words yourself

I got a problem when i tried to change the color of Fox and Falcos lasers in 20XX. I've downloaded a file with purple firefox and shine and that works fine. But when i changed the color myself, the different laser color is only visable when I play NTSC, not PAL (Im from Sweden so its pretty important to play PAL.). But the firefox and shine works in both versions. So NTSC Fox and Falco have fancy lasers but the PAL versions still have the red one. Is there a different place in the Fox and Falco file that I also have to change to make it apply to the PAL versions?

--- Post #218 ---
User: The Shadow
Date: Jun 25, 2015
----------------------------------------
When you load the PAL version it's loads an entirely different file. I'm guessing it's a trophy file. 

Search around the 20XX download folder or ask Achillies himself about the file used. 

Both Fox and Falco are affected by the Firefox and shine because they use one file (EfFxData) their lasers on the other hand use separate files (PlFx, and PlFc I believe).

A few things:

2) How do you change the color of the inside of Falco's jacket?

3) How do you change the up-B of Fox/Falco. I wanna take the purple one and change it up a bit.

Thanks in advance to anyone who helps!!

Note: I already looked at the first few posts, but whenever I go into the Hex editor and change things up, it just stays the same! :/

I've tried using these on netplay before but it kept causing desyncs, any reason why? I added the fire effect back to Fox and Falco's up-b with crazy hand too, but it was still causing desyncs, while other mods like the rainbow shine and blue lasers aren't causing desyncs.

I've been using it on netplay with the All the files except PlFc.dat and PlFx.dat, so the file with shine and the one EfCo file seem fine for netplay. It's gotta be something with the individual character files. I don't think changing the aura in the character files is what's causing desyncs. I think it may be that the PlFx.dat file removed part of the flame effect on Fox's up-b.

Edit: http://imgur.com/a/dAr37 the fire effect that's removed in your PlFx.dat and might be causing netplay desyncs

Long story short, directly after "Color 2", it seems there's a "Color 3"!

Just throwing that out there in case anyone wants to play with it and see if they can make it do anything. This can be found in the Properties tab for a texture in DTW, near the bottom of the Texture Environment Structure. This was previously called the Lance Color Struct, but we found out what it was really called, and redefined the properties in it.

You're better off doing it yourself, it's not too difficult. You can use Dat Texture Wizard to extract the PlMr.dat file, use a hex editor to edit the file with the above info, and then use DTW again to put your file back in your game.

Does anyone in here know why this is happening and how i can change it... Everytime i make falco feathers black when you are in game he has a blueish tint to him. IT is NOT true black. The only exception is on his red color, those tend to be true black for some reason. PLEASE HELP

Hey everyone...

I have a huge and annoying favor to ask...

Would anyone be able to compile the following and send it to me?

Falco: Blue Laser, Fox: Green Laser, Fox/Falco: Rainbow Shine, Purple Up-B, Pink Side-B.

This would be greatly appreciated and would complete my ultimate ISO (which I plan on sharing publicly... so long as I can find a legal way to do it)!

Thanks in advance to anyone who helps!!

Just wondering, is there a way to change the colors of the P1/P2/P3/P4,s in the character selection screen? If so... how? For instance, P1 is Red, P2 is Blue, P3 is Yellow and P4 is Green. If you know how then please let me know.

I don't suppose it would be possible to change the effect colour of say darkness that an attack has on a character. I just think it would be cool if falco's moves made the opponents light up with blue fire rather than just darkness fire or normal fire. thanks.

Offsets

Single Player Top Frame: 0x382F04

Single Player Bottom Frame: 0x382E44

I also just updated an application I wrote a year ago, that makes it easier to modify the CSS, to include support for Slippi 2.0 (it can now change the Slippi top and bottom frames of the CSS).

I need help with a mod to change the hit effects to blood. (edgy I know)

Also if possible to change the death explosions to something else too like a regular explosion or mushroom cloud.

I know how to change the textures, but can't find the offsets or figure out how to do it.

If anyone could help me figure it out that would be great, I'd even be willing to pay if someone would do it for me.

This is the thread I was looking at to change the textures, which is easy enough.

Lately I've been documenting a ton of offsets in EfCoData with the use of scripts, here are my findings: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZP_0i9dy9o5W-lzFwu_CAqc9kttd6-_j3jq0rt1tDls/edit?usp=sharing 

I'm dreaming of having all the offsets in this thread be in a single document that could be used by scripts to easily make color effect modpacks, and bypass the tedious practice of manually changing colors at offsets in a hex editor.

I changed Falco's laser color and it worked on Dolphin, but when I play on console it freezes after I try to shoot lasers. I have rainbow shine and it works and I've seen people playing with changed lasers on console, so I don't know what the problem is.

Edit: I changed Pikachu's Thunder and it worked on both, but Falco's still didn't.

Nvm I fixed it.

I have my player 3 emblems and magnifying glass thing modified to be purple instead of yellow, but the "P3" thing that sometimes appears over the character is still yellow. I don't know where the offset that controls the color of that is. It's not part of the texture.

Scrump, what you are looking for is a value that is calculated and stored in memory (in different places based on certain criteria). It requires ASM coding to change.

Also the value is written again after every stock lost, I can't think of reason the game would do that.

As far as I know the Shine colors have nothing to do with the Fire Fox colors.

Just look at the FIRST PAGE, Lanceinthepants describes how to change them.

 
 Spoiler
 
 

So what you can do is open the file with the edited blue and black shine and open the not edited file next to it and compare them. Then only edit the shine colors in the not edited file. Then you have the normal fire fox and a blue and black shine.

Ive been doing some research on making structures in a dat file and Im certain that the 4248 structure is the color node described in the dat documentation. So its a 0x14 length structure were the words are in order of RBBA diffuse, RGBA Ambient, RGBA Specular, unknown (typically 1.0), and unknown (Shininess?).

While I was browsing through the file I found a color node that and 4348 as its 'shininess' value. So this might help you guys in looking for more as they arent necessarily 4248 and its easier to find when you understand a dat file. I didnt look into the other color types. I just came across this one.

Now that I understand the dat file looking at masterhand again I can truly appreciate how amazing it is.

This only works for characters but you can change color values here. (didnt test if it was saved but you can at least get the offsets)

The unknowns are the values I described in the previous post.

 The "unknown (typically 1.0)" is a transparency value. I talked about it here

Every time that I've looked at changing the 42480000 value I haven't noticed a difference when changing it. I've been planning on checking it since I found a bunch of them with different values in the GrPs.usd file. Most of them are around 42480000 however. An example is at 0x8A60: 191919FF 383E45FF FFFFFFFF 3F800000 4182E8BA.
 
 

 
Dunno know what to tell you. The color node I made worked fine when changing the values. I believe there is a max and min so try not going over 50ish.

Just found that the 070707 format is referenced by the unknown structure at the end of the texture structure. Can now probably add cI8 images and color them. Possibly.

I assume that random offsets are just one of the other formats but with changed flags. Now I just have to run across the cf format.

 Actually, I just noticed an error or incomplete detail in this.

The 00055860 in blue above is a part of the texture image data header, the final pointer to the actual image data. Same with the places in red after that.

What do you mean by the 'Texture' areas? What exactly is that data?
 
 

 
I think he just has it highlighted so that different types of pointers are different colors and the image pointers are just a light color but still highlighted. The texture area is the yellow. Points to image structure and pallets and what I realize a bit ago was the 070707 format. And you can move an image around on the face i think if you play with some of the settings.

Maybe not on GIMR's stream but even 20XX is played a lot in tournament, because it's generally fine

Texture changes can give an advantage/affect/throw off players. I'd say that "mild" texture mods are OK, but it's really up to the TO. Also, a good rule would also be that all players in the match must be OK with the custom textures in use or only vanilla is allowed.

A lot of Brawl tournaments in the past used texture mods to discern between character colors in doubles. I'm p sure this is fine.

Could somebody help me with something I'm trying to add in? I'm currently trying to edit the hex in Peach's file so I can add the effect "darkness" to whenever she pulls out a turnip, but I'm not too sure which set it's found in and which ones I'm supposed to edit...

I believe that would be a graphical effect in crazyhand you'd want to add.

Yeah I'd like these too, sickkk. However, is it possible to get these colors for specific skins? For example, could I make orange fox have an orange shine and have white fox have a white shine?

What about Marth? Can Red Marth have a red sword swing and can White Marth have a white sword swing?

 Not to mention i even tried to change the color of the falcon punch but i was trying to make all of his fire into dark captain falcon punch, raptor boost, Falcon Kick and Falcon Dive so that he has more fire. Its this i used to make it so that he can burn with his darkness.

Ok, you see the problem doesn't come from the fuel of the burning fire, its the move itself. When I up-b with captain falcon, the enemy just explodes but there is no knockback, at all, and the fact that his falcon punch now has the power of the warlock punch.. And fyi. Potassium cholride (KCl) burns with a bright orange flame rather than a purple one, unlike as potassium bitartrate. The emmission spectra for this substance best suits the colour of ganondorfs higher energy flame.

 Fox's and Falco's up B flames are in EfFxData.dat. Replacing EfFxData.dat with the one in @nube's purple Firefox/Firebird download results in purple flames (obviously for both of them).

I've never really done stuff with textures with hex editing (just Melee Toolkit), but I'm really interested now. I'm fairly certain that someone who knew what they were doing could find the offsets for the textures in question simply by comparing Nube's EfFxData.dat with an unedited one. It looks to me like one starts at 0x18DA0, and I have no idea what I'm doing. Continuing on that, where would I get started on learning about textures on the hex level?
 
 

 
Yea every single one of the textures for the the fire fox and fire bird are _9 textures. I can give you the file names for the textures if that'll help find the offsets for the textures.

go to offset 22050 or search this in your hex editor 00 99 FF FF CC E6 FF FF FF FF FF FF 3E 99 99 9A 42 48 00

change 00 99 FF to whatever color of red you want

and change CC E6 FF to the color of red you used for color 1

I've successfully changed the logo on white marth's cape (PlMsWh offset 00061320) and it's showing up, but it's only faintly visible. There's a white glow which is making the texture a lot lighter than I want it to be and you can't really see it when Marth is standing, facing to the right. I've tested this with neutral marth too and noticed there seems to always be a tint applied to the cape (for PlMsNr its purple-ish). So I assume there's some hex values that control that tint? I've tried looking for it by file comparisons but so far I haven't really stumbled upon anything that fits the typical patterns... Does anyone have an idea?

The only other explanation I could think of is that it has something to do with the type of material the cape is set to? (Like with stagemodels, some are plastic, some are gritty, .... )

For convenience. Doesn't do anything new.

http://www.mediafire.com/download/waj4vqjau4uxuuv/Effect_Changer.zip

Many (all?) of Lance's offsets are not exact, though, and if you just put them in and change the colors it will probably freeze the game or have really weird effects.

 
 

 
 
 Lanceinthepants said:
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 So the format actually doesn't start at 1EC40 but rather 1EC48. Basically my fault for lazy documentation, I just recorded what line things started on.
 
 

 
The offset it wants is the very beginning of the format, i.e. the offset of the first 07 for 07 07 07 format, 98 for 98 00 ## ## format, the first color for 42 48 format (aka the offset of 42 - 0x10), and the CF in CF ## format. Does color previews (what's currently in the dat). Uses the 2 bytes at offset + 0x2 for the number of colors in 98 00 ## ##'s.

The offset is in hexadecimal, you can put 0x if you want but don't have to.

Quick Update

Yea so I am in the process of salvaging my laptop's hard drive. Once i get that I will post some more stuff. My goal was to make an a pretty good looking color change ISO before Apex, but I'm not sure if I will be able to get that done. Its probably good this happened with finals coming up, but I was hoping I would have had more stuff done by now =( Over Christmas break I expect I will update this alot though.

Any clue how to change the "flare" when fox/falco shoots their laser? as it is right now, say you change the laser color to yellow.. you shoot a yellow laser, but the "flare" is still red. just looks off, hopefully someone has attempted to find it!

Yea both me and Mr H have looked for this unsuccessfully. I agree with you it does look off. I am purchasing a new laptop this afternoon so I will look some more at this.

Yeah, it's exactly what you think it is. I messed around with all of that on Ganon. From my memory, the first offset is angled up, and the other is angled down.

Very nice. Can't believe I changed all the character Smash attacks already... but those altered effects look SICK in-game. *_*

Just a side note, I couldn't find the Smash Attack charge colors for Ness's down-smash or up-smash... Only his forward-smash. Is there some alternate hex I'd have to look for to find those? If I can't change him, that's fine, I'm just curious.

His up and down smash do not have the Start Smash Charge command. That's why.

Haha sorry if I worded my guide badly, but yes those extra offsets are the angles of the forward smash.

Also that is pretty interesting about Ness. I will have to look at his data.

Hey do you think someone could reupload Blue Falcon Punch and Purple Firefox and send me the links.

I ended up losing everything on my old laptop. Most of the stuff I put in this thread but there was some stuff I had put a lot of work into and were almost finished (Different colors on Pokemon Stadium Platforms, Mario Ice Ball, a Dr Mario texture that looked like Dexter from Dexter's Lab, part of a guide to change auras to other moves besides smashes, and other things I had put at least some time into) and that really made me lose my motivation. I still plan on writing the guide for changing the other auras though.

So the other day I had someone remark on how cool it would be for them to have multiple Falco laser colors for different costumes and I told them that from my knowledge it was impossible to do this since the data for Falco's laser color required editing his model file to edit the color. Afterwards however I got around to thinking and now I'm really curious if its possible to have something like Falco's laser color or the color of Marth's blade when he swings be different based on the controller port number you have, much like how your shield color depends on your controller port in singles. Something tells me that its different for shields and therefore not applicable to other textures, but I'm really curious about it and had to ask.

ah

Speaking of that... In your guide, you note how you can change the Forward Smash (up-forward-down tilts when possible), the Down Smash, and Up Smash. I noticed the other day when we randomly had items on, characters also have Smash attack charges when charging held items like the Beam Sword, and I think these are the offsets found later in their files. Were these going to be covered too ?

Sorry man but this is impossible. The data in the file that controls this stuff applies it to the character no matter what port or costume you choose.

Yea after the first 3 or 5 smash offsets (5 offsets if there is angled forward smashes) there will be 5 more offsets that have the the charged smash data. If i recall correctly their order will go Beam Sword, Home-Run Bat, Fan, Star Rod, Lip Stick. These offsets start later in the file (around offset 6000 in the character files).

Not to mention i even tried to change the color of the falcon punch but i was trying to make all of his fire into dark captain falcon punch, raptor boost, Falcon Kick and Falcon Dive so that he has more fire. Its this i used to make it so that he can burn with his darkness.

From the OP, I noticed that the sword effect is in PIMs.dat, but this seems to effect the sword swing for every costume. Is it possible to have different sword effects per costume? I think the 20XX hack pack does this.

If you mean the move's type (fire, electric, darkness, etc.): Cosmetic Hitbox Element Guide

If you mean effects like sparkles or other graphics, you'll want to look at Itaru's thread: Melee Syntax and Guide. Let's make super characters!

and maybe look around here. 

Or you can wait until Crazy Hand includes the functionality.

@
 
 Miyuki
 shine and firefox are in EfFxData, while lasers, phantasm, etc. are in plfx and plfc, so it shouldnt change lasers at all; you would have to change the respective bytes for shine on the file with the firefox (you could do it vice versa, but it is easier to go this way because a lot of the fire fox is textures)

so, for shine, you would take the values between the offsets of 1C2A0 - 1C340 and c/p them over the same offsets in the file that contains the firefox

Note: there are more hex values to change if you want the beginning frames of shine to be a different color (check op)

 Is there any way to get this purple shine and the purple firefox that Lanceinthepants posted on one EfFxData.dat file? SUPER DOOPER PLZ

-Edit OMG this changes the lasers as well LOL

Purple Shine / Purple Firefox / light blue lasers for fox and falco?
 
 

 
I am a bit lazy right now so link me directly to the posts of the purple firefox and blue lasers and I'll do it.

Is it possible to have Fox's Up-B one color (lets say blue), and Falco's another (lets say green)? Or do they have to be the same?

EDIT: I asked around, the answer is that they all have to be the same.

The Mario coin pummel and Bowser fire f-smash links no longer work. Does anyone have those files on hand by any chance?

Also, would it be possible for Doc to have a different tornado color than Mario? I'm just wondering if it's like Fox and Falco's recoveries where they share the same file.

Does changing color effects cause desyncs on netplay like when you change textures?

I would assume so. It changes the character files. I don't even know what the cause of the textures causing desynchs are, but it should be the same.

Texture changes cannot cause desyncs. Effect changes shouldn't either if they're static changes to a simple hex color or something, but I suppose one might if it's a more complex ASM code that's being run to do it. But probably most easily fall within the former category.

I really wonder to what extent modifications affect the random number generator or cause desynchs. For example, I've changed marth's tipper hitboxes effects from slash to darkness, which in normal gameplay should do absolutely nothing (I believe slashed effects give away DI or something like that, it was something complicated though and I don't remember much), but it did in fact cause desynchs. This presents to me two options, the effects actually have secret functions that we don't know of, or somehow it is tied into the RNG.

Yeah, changing hitbox effects will cause desyncs, because it changes the outcomes of physics interactions. oscat mentioned color effects though, so I think he means things like laser/shine colors, lightning bolt colors, etc. (basically model parts or textures that are colored by a static/unchanging values within the game), which wouldn't affect the running or syncing of the game at all. 

Something like the Rainbow FD code might be a different case though, because rather than a value that's simply read, it's actually a code that's run, which means one game (assuming only one of them has this enabled) is now going through more/different lines of code than the other. I don't know the specifics on how the game or emulator might ignore or compensate for that kind of difference.

To my knowledge most hitbox effects do absolutely nothing, is the descriptions of them leaving information out? Or is it that it somehow runs lines of code differently and that messes it up. This almost bothers me as much as the most important question ever.

One game would run through a function to produce a character aura (darkness), and the other game would not be running through this code = desync

Does anyone know what the offset is for the sparkle at the beginning of Fox's Illusion (seen here)? I see in this video from 2011 that someone has found it. Actually, based on earlier comments, I believe that the uploader of this video is a former roommate of Lanceinthepants? Any help would be appreciated!

P.S. If no one knows where it is what should my course of action be? Going through the PlFx.dat and EfFxData.dat files testing every color format (07 07 07, 98 ## ## ##, 42 48, and CF ##)?

You'll have to use a little intuition and use that hex editor to locate what you need. Don't let the first page discourage you you gotta read it!

In your gcr you can select your .iso, and find your .dat file that you wanna replace, then [Right-Click -> Import] the new one.

If that doesn't work fail safe it by just rebuilding a new one with it in the root folder.

Important Note - Only Normal, Slash, Coin, Darkness, and for our purposes Fire are truly cosmetic. Changing an element to or from something not cosmetic will change how the game inherently functions. I would advise sticking to only these 5 elements.

I thought I read somewhere that the different effects causes the attack to do more damage or hitstun or SOMETHING like that. I hope I'm wrong. 'Cause that would suck.

For example, if you gave Falcon an electric effect on his f-smash, it does more damage or it changes knockback/hitstun etc.

So does this apply to all attacks? For example, Roy's up-b was changed to have an electric effect. Would what you said apply here too? I'm trying to find out if this applies to attacks that don't have an effect in the first place, or if it also applies to attacks that already have an effect such as Ganondorf's down+b.

And yeah, it has no effect on gameplay. Fire, darkness, coin, slash, and "normal" hits don't do anything gameplay-wise. Damage % isn't altered, either; damage has set numbers in the file, and they remain that way unless changed intentionally.

OK... I'm stumped.

I was browsing around through moves, writing down nairs and such, and I came across Kirby... In the Master Hand program, it says his base damage is "12", but in-game it only takes 10 . . . and when I try to edit the base damage, it doesn't work. The base knockback can be messed with, but the base damage isn't touched. What gives?

If you look at the data just after the hitbox, you can see a bunch of async timers, each followed by [30 00 00 xx] with xx being the damage that Kirby's nair does at different times. The first timer is set to 8 frames, two frames before the nair comes out, so the damage dictated by the hitbox information is never seen.

 
 

 

 Code:

B moves function a somewhat differently than A attacks. Because Jigglypuff's B is a 'charge' attack there is likely another modifier for the increase in damage the longer you charge for. 

This data is usually located right after the characters attributes and isn't visible within the Masterhand program.
