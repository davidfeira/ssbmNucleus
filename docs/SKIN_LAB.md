# Skin Lab — AI / scriptable skin creation

A REST surface over the Skin Creator's machinery so an AI agent (or any
script) can create character skins end-to-end: open a costume in a live
HSDRawViewer, fetch/replace textures, run the color-palette tool, reposition
the 3D camera and grab rendered frames, pose real animations, and save the
result back to the vault as a new skin.

All endpoints live under `/api/mex/skin-lab/` on the Nucleus backend. One
session at a time (it owns a real OpenGL window — you will see it appear).

Implementation: `backend/blueprints/skin_lab.py` (routes),
`backend/skinlab/session.py` (HSDRawViewer `--stream` WebSocket client),
`backend/skinlab/palette.py` (numpy port of the UI palette tool).

## Typical agent loop

```text
POST /open {"character":"Fox","skinId":"c9-plfxc9"}    -> textures listed
GET  /frame                                            -> look at the model
GET  /texture/3                                        -> inspect a texture
POST /texture/3 (file or {data: b64})                  -> paint / replace it
POST /palette/analyze {"maxGroups":5}                  -> color groups
POST /palette/apply {"adjustments":[{"index":2,"hueShift":105}]}
POST /camera {"rotY":150,"scale":1.6}                  -> view the back
GET  /frame                                            -> verify the change
POST /save {"name":"My Colorway"}                      -> new vault skin
POST /close
```

## Endpoints

### Session
- `POST /open` — body one of:
  - `{character, skinId}` — a vault skin. `character` accepts canonical names
    (`"Fox"`) AND custom-character pseudo keys
    (`"custom_characters/<slug>/skins"`, `".../costumes"`).
  - `{character, costumeCode}` — a vanilla costume (e.g. `"PlFxNr"`).
  - `{datPath}` — any costume DAT on disk (optional `character` for scene/AJ).
  Returns the texture list (index/name/size), camera state, animation info.
- `GET /status` — `{open, session}`.
- `POST /close` — kill the viewer, drop all state.

### Textures
- `GET /textures` — list + which indexes have been edited.
- `GET /texture/<i>` — full-res PNG (the edited version once you've pushed one).
- `POST /texture/<i>` — multipart `file` or JSON `{data: <base64 png>}`;
  auto-resized to the texture's native size. Shows up in the 3D view live.

### Viewing the model
- `POST /camera` — absolute `{rotX, rotY, scale, x, y}` (degrees; scale = zoom,
  bigger is closer) or relative `{deltaRotX, deltaRotY, deltaZoom, deltaX, deltaY}`.
- `GET /frame?fresh=2&width=&height=` — current render as JPEG. `fresh` waits
  that many new frames so your latest changes are in the shot.
- `GET /anims` — the character's real animation symbols (from the AJ archive).
- `POST /anim` — `{symbol}` to load, `{frame}` to pose a frame (pauses),
  `{playing: true|false}`.

### Color palette tool (same algorithm as the UI)
- `POST /palette/analyze {maxGroups?: 8}` — clusters every texture's pixels
  into hue groups; returns `[{index, centerHue, hueRange, pixelCount,
  displayColor, avgSaturation, avgLightness}]`. Snapshots current textures.
- `POST /palette/apply {adjustments: [{index, hueShift?, saturationShift?}]}` —
  recolors from the snapshot (shifts are ABSOLUTE, so re-applying with new
  values replaces, never stacks). Lightness is untouched so shading survives.
- `POST /palette/reset` — push the snapshot back.

### AssetFarm bridge (texture generation)
- `POST /generate-texture {prompt, index?, recipe?, model?, seed?, width?,
  height?, name?}` — generates an image with the sibling assetFarm project
  (local diffusion; `NUCLEUS_ASSETFARM_DIR` overrides the default
  `~/projects/assetFarm`). Default recipe `tileset_tile`; see
  `python -m assetfarm list-recipes` for others. With `index`, the result is
  resized onto that texture in the open session; without, it just returns
  `imagePath`. First call loads the model — slow.

### Saving
- `GET /export-dat` — the edited DAT bytes (every pushed texture included).
- `POST /save {name}` — exports and saves to the vault as a NEW skin:
  - custom-character pseudo keys → that character's Custom Skins
    (`skins/add`), keeping the original `Pl*` dat name.
  - everything else → the unified intake (`/import/file`) with the original
    `Pl*` dat name (the intake only recognizes `Pl*`-stemmed DATs) and
    `custom_title` = your name. CSP/stock previews are auto-generated and
    slippi validation runs, exactly like a hand-imported skin.
  - intake dialogs (slippi-unsafe / duplicate) come back as the intake's own
    response payloads; pass `slippi_action` / `duplicate_action` through the
    save body to answer them.

## Gotchas

- The viewer streams JPEG frames continuously; the session throttles it to
  ~10 fps. `GET /frame` is the supported way to "see" — don't try to read the
  WebSocket yourself.
- Camera state is tracked backend-side by mirroring the protocol's delta math
  (the stream protocol has no absolute set). If something external moves the
  camera (nobody should), tracked state drifts.
- `GET /texture/<i>` returns the ORIGINAL from the DAT until you push an edit
  (the viewer caches its texture list at startup); the lab tracks edits and
  serves those back.
- Palette analyze on a freshly opened skin = originals at full resolution
  (better than the UI, which analyzes thumbnails).
- Eyes/details sharing a hue with clothes recolor together — same as the UI
  tool. For surgical edits, fetch the texture, edit pixels, push it back.
