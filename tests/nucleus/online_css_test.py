"""
online_css_test.py -- enter the Slippi ONLINE (unranked) character-select screen
and report whether it loaded HEALTHY or CRASHED. The online CSS uses more memory
than the offline VS CSS, so it's the worst case for CSP-memory overflow (too many
/ too-high-res CSPs). Used to find where the auto-compression formula must cap.

The modded ISO boots straight to the Slippi "Online Play" menu (Unranked
highlighted, scene 0x1). Pressing A enters the online CSS (scene 0x8), where the
CSPs load -- a memory crash happens HERE, within a second or two, BEFORE
matchmaking finds anyone. We detect crash/healthy fast and then HOLD B to leave
(so we never actually match a real player / start a game).

    python online_css_test.py        # attaches to the session pid

Exit 0 = healthy (CSS loaded + ran), 1 = crashed/hung, 2 = couldn't enter.
