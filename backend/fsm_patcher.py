"""Frame Speed Modifier (FSM) engine patcher.

Bakes Magus420's FSM engine (the "(DOL) FSM Engine" patch from Crazy Hand)
directly into a project's sys/main.dol, so legacy moveset mods that ship a
Crazy Hand FSM .txt work in Nucleus/m-ex builds with zero Gecko code-space
cost.

How the engine works (NTSC 1.02):
  - A ~224-byte PPC routine is written into the debug-menu strings region of
    the DOL (file 0x4088B0, RAM 0x8040B8A8). That region only holds
    "PUSH START BUTTON" / "MEM DUMP" debug-screen text and is the same spot
    Crazy Hand has used for years; m-ex leaves it untouched.
  - An entry table follows at file 0x4089B0 (RAM 0x8040B9A8): up to 150
    entries of 8 bytes each, zero-terminated.
  - One instruction in the animation-advance epilogue (file 0x6FF18,
    RAM 0x80073330, vanilla `lmw r27,0x14(r1)` = BB610014) is replaced with a
    branch into the engine. The engine re-executes the displaced instruction
    and branches back.

Entry format (matches Crazy Hand's FSM .txt lines `b0,b1,b2,b3,float`):
  b0    character ID (EXTERNAL id - rewritten at build time for added chars)
  b1    starting frame
  b2/b3 flags + subaction/action id (0x80 bit = subaction, low bit of b2 is
        bit 8 of the subaction id)
  float animation speed multiplier (big endian)

The engine matches entries against the external character ID read from the
static player blocks, so added m-ex fighters work as long as the entry's ID
byte equals their external slot id - and vanilla characters are unaffected
unless explicitly listed.
