"""
Regression test for the metadata.json read-modify-write race that silently
dropped vault entries (the seeded Giga Bowser vanished when several custom
characters were imported at once). A multi-file drag fires many concurrent
/import/file requests on Flask's threaded server; without a lock + atomic write
their appends clobber each other. `_append_custom_character` must keep every
entry, including a pre-existing one.

custom_characters now routes its metadata IO through the core.metadata DAL, so
these tests drive the unified path via the `vault` fixture (which redirects the
DAL's metadata file at a temp vault).
